        <p>My first touch with technologies started when I was 2 years old.
            My old man bought a PC and no one in household could use it.
            I had an uncle who could use it and he taught me all he knew, I fell in love.
            <br><br>
            My first college was EFOS, but I quit in a first year.
            I didn't like it at all because I was a hardcore gamer and all I wanted was to be with my beloved PC.
            So I decided join IPI Akademija in Tuzla to study IT.

        <p>Fast forward 3 years later and my journey is starting to look serious,
            I realised I love developing and I want to dive deep and challenge myself.<br><br>
            My general hobbies are a lot of driving at night, gaming and sports.
            I love closely watching how our technology grows, catching trends and seeing where it is all heading.
            I am open minded and curious, with a hunger for knowledge and information.</p>
